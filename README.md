# Sakai Github Dockerized

## Install

Use `git clone https://github.com/profmikegreene/sakai-master-docker.git` to grab this repository. 

You can then `cd` to the folder you cloned into and either `bash startup.sh` or run the individual commands manually.

You may want to adjust the CPU/RAM you give Docker and the variables in startup.sh:5 and tomcat/Dockerfile:6 if you have more or less resources to devote to the build. The defaults can consume up to 6GB of RAM and 4 CPUs.

This will take a while (mine took 62m), grab a coffee.

This creates a temporary container to do the maven build and starts containers for

* tomcat - to serve the built sakai 
* mysql - to store sakai db
* phpmyadmin - GUI for sakai db

Visit [http://localhost:7777/portal](http://localhost:7777/portal) or whatever port you chose as `TOMCAT_PORT` in .env


### todo
- how to restart tomcat without shutting container down if you want to dev and redeploy?


You `git` outside of docker

Sakai docker what if it came pre-built it was more about demo than master you can use tags or environmental variables to choose the branch but if you want the latest youâ€™re going to have to rebuild it. That should speed up the deploy for new people
