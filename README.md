# Sakai Github Dockerized

## Install

`git clone https://github.com/profmikegreene/sakai-master-docker.git` to grab this repository.

`cd` to the folder you cloned into.

Run the startup.sh script or run the commands individually
`bash startup.sh`

Note: If you cloned this directory under a different name, the startup.sh script won't work as the docker commands use sakaimasterdocker as the root image name. Review startup.sh if you receive docker image not found errors.

Note: On `docker-compose up` you will get a maven build failure. I do not know how to prevent maven from starting on docker-compose up while still being built for all the previous builds.

You may want to adjust the CPU/RAM you give Docker and the variables in startup.sh:5 and tomcat/Dockerfile:6 if you have more or less resources to devote to the build. The defaults can consume up to 6GB of RAM and 4 CPUs.

This will take a while (mine took 62m), grab a coffee.

This creates a temporary container to do the maven build and starts containers for

* tomcat - to serve the built sakai
* mysql - to store sakai db
* phpmyadmin - GUI for sakai db

Visit [http://localhost/portal](http://localhost/portal) or whatever localhost:port/portal if you chose another port as `TOMCAT_PORT` in .env


### todo
- how to restart tomcat without shutting container down if you want to dev and redeploy?

### blah
You `git` outside of docker

Sakai docker what if it came pre-built it was more about demo than master you can use tags or environmental variables to choose the branch but if you want the latest youâ€™re going to have to rebuild it. That should speed up the deploy for new people

Take properties from nightly

Use a multistage build to merge maven and tomcat together? 
- I like having them separated because you could run maven commands independantly.
- perhaps it would be better to put them on the same image and then you could alias mvn clean install sakai:deploy to include a tomcat restart?


ignore/src contains a sakaiproject/sakai git clone

what does maven/target/lib look like after a sakai:deploy? Do any of the original binaries remain unchanged?
